# Kayako-rtl

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)

A Chrome extension to enable RTL support for Arabic in any Kayako instance

## Description âœ¨

The extension isn't really doing anything fancy, it just monitors the tab updates in the browser and compares the page URL with a standard Kayako Conversation page URL. If a match is found, the content script is invoked which fetches all the posts in Arabic language and append the style ` "direction:rtl" `

## Installation ðŸ’»

- Open the Google Chrome browser
- Bring up the extensions management page by clicking the spanner icon and choose Tools > Extensions
- Tick the developer mode checkbox in the top right corner.
- Click 'Load unpacked extension' and select your folder (enclosed with this post) and click 'OK'. If all the files are valid and named correctly, a blue dot icon should appear next to the address bar with the other extensions.
